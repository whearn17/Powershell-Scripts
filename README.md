# Powershell Scripts

This GitHub repo contains a collection of PowerShell scripts that I've developed to automate various tasks in Active Directory and other areas of IT administration.

These scripts require PowerShell version 5.1 or later, and the Active Directory PowerShell module to be installed on the system running the scripts.

To use the scripts, simply download the repo and extract the contents to a directory of your choice. To run a script, open PowerShell and navigate 
to the directory containing the script, then run the script using the PowerShell command line.

If you find a bug or have an idea for a new feature, feel free to open an issue on GitHub or submit a pull request with your changes.
